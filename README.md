# Food Delivery Time Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict food delivery times for new orders using historical delivery data. By accurately estimating delivery times, the model helps optimize logistics operations and improve customer satisfaction.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering to clean and enhance the input data.
- Evaluation and comparison of multiple regression models to find the best fit.
- Implementation of Random Forest Regression, which delivered the highest accuracy.
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance and prevent overfitting.
- Achieved a strong RÂ² score of 0.84, indicating reliable predictions.
